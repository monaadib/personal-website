					<p>I just want to start off by saying that my shy bladder days are over. 
					</p> <br>

					<p>I didn't really know what to expect from The Hague. After some basic research, I assumed it was just another city made of canals, museums and a beach. But oh boy, oh boy, the city had so much more to offer.  
					</p> <br>

					<p>I think I liked The Hague because the city has a calming and optimistic vibe. First off, the city is surrounded by nature. To travel through parts of the city, we took paths through forests or streets that went by farms. Then there's all of the buildings dedicated to world peace: the Peace Palace, the International Criminal Court and the streets filled with embassies. Don't get me wrong, these places seem to tell a one-sided story, an idealization of their mission for peace and justice. But it felt good to know that there are success stories. 
					</p> <br>


					<p>Overall, I think Cindy  and I would both agree that The Hague is a very livable city. These are some things I saw that stood out to me: </p>
					
					<br>
					<ul>
						<li> Richard Hutton's "S(h)it On It". Richard Hutton has an exhibit at the Gemeentemuseum on chair designs. His bench design "S(h)it On It" was made for an exhibition in Verona and at the time, neofascism had made a comeback in Italian politics. He made a statement with his bench. In a different exhibition, a visitor scratched "nie wieder" ("never again") into the bench. Hutton deepened the inscription with a screwdriver.  </li>

						<li> Jan Steen's "The Sick Girl". The painting depicts a girl being examined by a doctor and pretending to suffer from a "wandering womb". At the time, the remedy for a "wandering womb" was for the patient to sleep with her lover. On an even funnier note, apparently physicians of Ancient Greece had a lot of theories about the womb including that you could lure a wandering womb back into a position with certain smells <a href = "https://www.wired.com/2014/05/fantastically-wrong-wandering-womb/">(read article for a good time)</a> </li>
						
					  </ul> <br>
					
					  <p>Oh, and about the shy bladder. If you know me well or have been lucky enough to go to the bathroom with me, you probably know that it's hard for me to pee around others. Desperate and already in the water, I wasn't left with much choice. I peed in the North Sea.  </p> <br>

					  <p>You're probably thinking: "dude, everyone pees in the ocean at some point". Well, I definitely was not one of those people two years ago. This sounds a bit ridiculous but it made me feel like I've grown up. In a way, it was a physical representation of how I've changed since high school and how I'm not uncomfortable or scared of the same things. Or maybe I overanalyzed the whole situation. Anyways, I made a funky, hip, super cool gif to commemorate my growth.  </p>
