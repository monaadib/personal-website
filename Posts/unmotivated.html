							<p>I am unmotivated.   </p>
							<br> <p>This three word revelation is nothing new to me. I've been thinking about this unsettling feeling for a while. I've talked to others, read countless forums (and by forums i mean reddit and only reddit) and tried watching motivational videos on YouTube, but the feeling still persists. I've gotten a lot reassurance, often reminded that this is normal. This is temporary. I shouldn't worry. But of course, I don't feel normal and man, oh man, I've been worrying.  </p>
						
							<br> <p>I've also gotten a lot of advice, the kind of stuff that I should have been doing anyway: exercising, reading, drinking water (and i guess the water in coffee doesn't count?!?), sleeping earlier, putting down my phone. Who knows? Maybe reddit is right. Maybe a cup of water a day keeps the unmotivated feelings away. </p>
							
							<br> <p>After all my thinking, I've come up with some theories about the origin of this feeling. </p>

							<br> <ul>
								<li> 1) I'm burnt out, for which perhaps the cure is time.  </li>
								<li> 2) I'm in this in-between stage as one chapter of my life recently ended and the next is soon starting. I guess my body is at a stand-still in anticipation of that next chapter. </li>
			
								
							  </ul>
							 <br> <p> And the one that's the most unsettling:  </p>
							 <br> 
							 <ul>
							  <li>  3) I'm uninspired.   </li>
							</ul>
							<br> <p> I have this intuitive feeling that while the first two may be partly contributing to my lack of motivation, the third theory is my main problem. I've been uninspired for a while, even before the summer break started, but I used my assignments, exams and extracurricular commitments to temporarily push those thoughts away. "I'll think about it later", I would say, always acknowledging that the thoughts were ever present, but that the time wasn't right to deal with them. I guess I don't have an excuse to push the thoughts away anymore. </p>
							<p>I started 2019 really excited. I had all these ideas about what I wanted to do -- things that are really mundane to most, but felt different and meaningful to me. I wanted to get my driver's license, go clubbing for the first time, go to my first dance class and ask acquaintances I admired out on coffee dates. I did most of these things, and felt really good about them, but somewhere along in the following months, I stopped having new ideas. Instead of being excited about trying something new, I get excited about going home.  </p>
							
							<br> <p>I'm not sure what to do. Maybe I'll start watching videos about "how to get inspired". Maybe I'll find myself during a hike. Maybe I'll force myself to read and watch movies and draw and dance, and the inspiration will hit me one day. 
							</p>
							<br> <p> Or maybe I'll just go home -- that sounds good for now.
